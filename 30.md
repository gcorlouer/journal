# Today
* Exploratroy data analysis on one subject: Gaussianity, Mean, var, std, kurtosis, violin/box plot X
* Time frequency analysis X
* Transfer preprocessing X
* Mail Itzik (prepared)
* Read neuroimag ?
* Maxine experiment V
* Freezer V

# Notes
subject 00:
11 Brodman ROIs
28 depth electrodes
List of bad channels ['TRIG', 'ECG', 'P3', 'T5', 'T3', 'F3', 'F7']
To convert numpy array to matlab, try convert to list
# Questions
Implications of depth electrodes for the analysis?
Channel location not available with current format

# Done
* Prepared Exploratroy analysis
* Found nie way to remove noise maybe (to test)
* Electrodes info and ROIs in nice table
* Remove bad channels
*
