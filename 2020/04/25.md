# Done
* Discovered arbtt time tracker
  - A bit of a learning curve before using it but seems nice
  - Need to protect privacy maybe
  - Based on Haskell
  - Main documentation on the arbtt website
* Learned a bit of Haskell
  - Functional programming seems more intuitive than imperative
  - Some potential advantage of imperative memorywise
* Read on Emacs and VIM
  - Emacs seems slighlty more interesting because more centralise (is more than an editor)
  - But seems like there is a bit of a learning curve
  - I would probably miss Hydrogen and Git integration with atom
  - I'll probably stick with atom for now
* Read chap 1 and a bit of chap 2 of Atom manual
  - Basically need to learn more shortcut
  - Need to be more effective with atom seems worth reading memorywise
* Administration
  - Healthcare: seems like I've lost it and not much to be done anyway
  - Need to have my parents saying that they host me so I can register to other bank
* Deep learning lesson 1 on colab partly done.
