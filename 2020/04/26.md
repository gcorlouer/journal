# What did we learn
progress on arbtt, thought about automating startup. Still need to understand
arbtt better. Renamed subject in data folder, start organsing according to BIDs
made a dictionary ancient to new subject. Read some python basics. Repetitive
python learning will probably be useful. First lesson deep learning lecture done
now can go on the practical session. Need to learn matching string with re module
in python. I think I'm still getting distracted too much.
